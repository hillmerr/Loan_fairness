# Mortgage Loan Project for CSCI 3358

Codebase for data analysis, deep dive on bias, and predictive modeling (calibration eval)

## Startup
Once the repo is downloaded, download data from https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/?geo=nationwide&records=all-records&field_descriptions=labels. be sure to use all records and include plain language labels for data analysis. TBD on whether we will use the plain language labels for model building (probabily will use the plain language label data source but not double count the labels that are repeated).
